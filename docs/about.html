		<h4>Description of the tools</h4>
			<p>
				We are using express and cors to create url routers that will allow users to make GET and PUT requests to our RESTful API. By using SQLite3, we have made it possible for users to remotely access all of the data from the Crime database without downloading any data they don't need.
			</p>
			<p>
				We used Leaftlet Js to create an interactive map. By modifying the map state and adding markers and event listeners, we integrated our crime model into the leaflet js view.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are using Nominatim API to both search and reverse search addresses in order to get latitude and longtidude coordinates. We make a request to the Nomanatim API when the user makes a search and when the map is panned or zoomed.
